### The project

This is one of my first projects as a freelance front-end developer. The page is for a hairdresser who works in a salon in the city of Helsinki, Finland. He asked that the page link to his online booking system where custmoers can book an appointment.

The online booking system was already ready and it is a system (Timma) used by all hair salons in Finland.
I developed the website layout myself. First, I built a header with the buttons "book now", "about" and "services".
These buttons disappear on smaller screens and are encapsulated in a sandwich menu made by JavaScript.

Just below, I created a section with cards for the user to view the types of services offered by the hairdresser. At the end of the page, there is an interactive image gallery also developed with JavaScript.
